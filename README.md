# Natural Language Processing - Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on developing a system to analyze the sentiment of textual data, distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments. The system leverages the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing, 
employing various techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and feature extraction to prepare the data for sentiment analysis.
